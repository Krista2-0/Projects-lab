### 🧠 About Project Lab

Project Lab is more than a repository — it is a place to grow knowledge, build a future, and monitor progress.

Rather than treating coding as a task that is completed and left behind, this repository exists to make writing code feel natural and consistent — a space that encourages growth and long-term commitment.

### 🌱 Mindset

Project Lab is built on the idea that progress requires care and consistency.  
Like anything meant to grow, it needs regular attention — practice, experimentation, and reflection.

This mindset turns coding into a habit, not a chore.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Direction

This repository will be used to build unique and innovative applications and websites using technologies I am learning and improving in:

- JavaScript  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- PHP  
- C  
- Python (planned)

### 📈 Growth

Project Lab will evolve over time.  
Each update represents progress — not perfection — and reflects continuous learning and development.
